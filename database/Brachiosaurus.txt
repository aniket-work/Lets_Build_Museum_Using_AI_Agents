Giant Herbivore: Brachiosaurus, meaning "arm lizard," was one of the largest dinosaurs to ever walk the Earth. It lived during the Late Jurassic Period, about 154 to 150 million years ago.
Immense Size: Brachiosaurus could reach lengths of up to 85 feet and a height of 52 feet at the shoulder. It weighed an estimated 28 to 58 tons.
Giraffe-Like Build: Its most distinctive feature was its long neck, held high above its body like a giraffe's. Its front legs were longer than its back legs, giving it a sloping back.
High Browser: Brachiosaurus's long neck allowed it to reach vegetation high in trees that other dinosaurs couldn't access. It likely fed on conifers, cycads, and ginkgoes.
Unique Nasal Openings: Its nostrils were located on top of its head, which has led to speculation about their function, possibly for underwater feeding or sound production.
Herding Behavior: Brachiosaurus is thought to have lived in herds, offering protection against predators and aiding in finding food.
Fossil Discoveries: Brachiosaurus fossils have been found in North America (mainly in the Morrison Formation) and Africa (Giraffatitan, a closely related genus).
Warm-Blooded?: There's debate about whether Brachiosaurus was warm-blooded like mammals or cold-blooded like reptiles. Some evidence suggests it might have been a gigantotherm, maintaining a stable body temperature due to its large size.
Slow Mover: Despite its size, Brachiosaurus was probably a slow mover, walking at speeds of 2 to 4 mph.
Cultural Impact: Brachiosaurus has been featured in numerous films and documentaries, most notably in "Jurassic Park," where it's depicted eating leaves from tall trees.
