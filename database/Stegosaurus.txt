Plated Dinosaur: Stegosaurus, meaning "roofed lizard," is famous for the large bony plates lining its back and the sharp spikes on its tail. It lived during the Late Jurassic Period, about 155 to 150 million years ago.
Size and Weight: Stegosaurus grew up to 30 feet long and 14 feet tall at the hips, weighing between 5 to 7 tons.
Herbivore: It was a herbivore, feeding on low-lying plants with its small head and weak jaws. Its teeth were designed for stripping leaves but not for chewing.
Plate Function: The function of Stegosaurus' plates is still debated. They might have been used for display, attracting mates, intimidating rivals, or thermoregulation (controlling body temperature).
Tail Spikes (Thagomizers): The four sharp spikes on its tail, known as "thagomizers," were likely used for defense against predators.
Brain Size: Stegosaurus had a relatively small brain compared to its body size, leading to the popular misconception that it was not very intelligent.
Social Behavior: Evidence suggests Stegosaurus might have lived in herds, though the exact nature of their social interactions is unknown.
Fossil Discoveries: Stegosaurus fossils have been found mainly in North America, with numerous well-preserved specimens providing insights into its anatomy and behavior.
Walking Posture: Stegosaurus walked on all fours, with its back legs longer than its front legs, resulting in a distinctive sloping posture.
Cultural Impact: Stegosaurus is a popular dinosaur, often featured in children's books, movies, and museums. Its unique appearance makes it easily recognizable and a favorite among dinosaur enthusiasts.
