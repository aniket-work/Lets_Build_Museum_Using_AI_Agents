Long-Necked Giant: Diplodocus, meaning "double beam," was one of the longest dinosaurs ever discovered. It lived during the Late Jurassic Period, approximately 154 to 145 million years ago.
Extreme Length: Diplodocus could reach lengths of up to 108 feet, with most of that length coming from its incredibly long neck and tail.
Whip-Like Tail: Its tail was extremely long and flexible, possibly used as a defensive weapon against predators or for communication within the herd.
Small Head: Diplodocus had a small head relative to its body size, with peg-like teeth designed for stripping leaves from branches.
Quadruped Herbivore: It was a herbivore, feeding on low-lying vegetation and the leaves of tall trees. Its long neck allowed it to reach a wider range of food sources.
Social Animals: Diplodocus likely lived in herds, providing protection and helping to find food.
Fossil Abundance: Numerous Diplodocus fossils have been found in North America, primarily in the Morrison Formation.
Walking Posture: Diplodocus walked on all fours with its neck and tail held horizontally to maintain balance.
Egg-Laying: Diplodocus reproduced by laying eggs, possibly in nesting grounds where multiple individuals would gather.
Cultural Icon: Diplodocus has become a symbol of the Jurassic Period, often depicted in museums and documentaries as a gentle giant.
