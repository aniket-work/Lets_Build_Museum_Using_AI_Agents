Bird-Like Dinosaur: Velociraptor, meaning "swift seizer," was a small, bird-like dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period (75 to 71 million years ago).
Size and Build: Velociraptors were much smaller than depicted in movies, reaching about 6.8 feet in length and 1.6 feet in height at the hip, with a weight of approximately 15â€“33 lbs.
Intelligence: Velociraptors are considered one of the more intelligent dinosaurs, with a large brain relative to their body size.
Pack Hunters: Evidence suggests that Velociraptors hunted in packs, using coordinated attacks to take down larger prey.
Deadly Claw: Their most famous feature was a large, retractable claw on each foot, which they likely used to slash and disembowel prey.
Feathered Dinosaurs: Velociraptors were covered in feathers, a feature that supports their close evolutionary relationship with birds.
Fossil Discoveries: Famous Velociraptor fossils include the "Fighting Dinosaurs" specimen, showing a Velociraptor locked in combat with a Protoceratops.
Fast and Agile: Velociraptors were fast runners and agile predators, capable of quick turns and jumps.
Warm-Blooded: Evidence suggests Velociraptors were likely warm-blooded, allowing them to maintain a high metabolism and active lifestyle.
Cultural Impact: Thanks to movies like "Jurassic Park," Velociraptors have become synonymous with cunning and deadly predators, though their portrayal in the films is often exaggerated.
