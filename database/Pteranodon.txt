Flying Reptile: Pteranodon, meaning "toothless wing," was not a dinosaur but a pterosaur, a flying reptile that lived during the Late Cretaceous period (88 to 86 million years ago).
Wingspan: Pteranodon had an impressive wingspan, ranging from 18 to 24 feet, making it one of the largest flying creatures of its time.
Toothless Beak: As its name suggests, Pteranodon had a toothless beak, which it likely used to catch fish from the sea.
Head Crest: It possessed a large, bony crest on its head, which could have been used for display, steering in flight, or thermoregulation.
Fish Eater: Pteranodon was a piscivore (fish eater), using its long beak to scoop fish out of the water.
Soaring Flight: It is believed to have been a skilled soarer, using thermals and air currents to stay aloft for long periods.
Fossil Discoveries: Pteranodon fossils have been found primarily in North America, particularly in the Niobrara Formation.
Social Behavior: Pteranodons likely lived in colonies, nesting on cliffs near the sea.
Sexual Dimorphism: There is evidence of sexual dimorphism in Pteranodon, with males having larger crests than females.
Not a Bird: Despite their ability to fly, Pteranodons were not birds. They represent a separate branch of reptiles that evolved flight independently of birds.
