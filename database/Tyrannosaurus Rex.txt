Tyrannosaurus Rex

Apex Predator: Tyrannosaurus Rex, meaning "Tyrant Lizard King," was one of the largest land predators of all time. It lived in the late Cretaceous period, approximately 68 to 66 million years ago.
Massive Size: T. Rex could reach up to 40 feet in length and 12 feet in height at the hips. It weighed between 5 to 8 tons.
Powerful Bite: Its skull was massive and designed for crushing bones. Its teeth, some as large as bananas, were serrated and constantly replaced.
Strong Legs, Small Arms: T. Rex had powerful legs built for running, but its arms were surprisingly small, likely used for grasping prey.
Scavenger or Hunter?: While primarily a hunter, T. Rex was also opportunistic and likely scavenged for food when necessary.
Fossil Discoveries: The first T. Rex skeleton was discovered in 1902 by Barnum Brown. Since then, many fossils have been found, providing valuable insights into its anatomy and behavior.
Popular Culture Icon: T. Rex has become a cultural icon, appearing in countless movies, books, and other forms of media. Its image is synonymous with power and ferocity.
Feathers?: Recent discoveries suggest that juvenile T. Rex might have had feathers, possibly for insulation or display.
Social Life?: Evidence suggests that T. Rex might have lived in groups or packs, though this is still debated by scientists.
Extinction: T. Rex, along with other non-avian dinosaurs, went extinct during the mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period, likely caused by an asteroid impact.
